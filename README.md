# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple and responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 
The game is designed for two players, and it automatically detects winners, draws, and allows the game to be reset. 
This project provides a fun, interactive user experience that works seamlessly across devices.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Players take turns to place 'X' and 'O' on a 3x3 grid.
- **Win detection**: Automatically checks for a winner (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- **Draw detection**: Declares the game a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
- **Reset functionality**: Allows players to restart the game at any time.
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the game.
- **CSS3**: Handles the visual styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including turn-taking, win detection, and board reset.

# Responsive Design

The game interface is fully responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes:

- **For screens larger than 800px**: The board occupies 70% of the width, with larger cells for better visibility.
- **For screens smaller than 800px**: The game adjusts to fit smaller devices while maintaining readability.
- **For screens smaller than 500px**: The layout further optimizes to ensure the game is playable on mobile devices, with reduced font sizes and optimized button sizes.

# Media Queries

- **@media (max-width: 800px)**: Adjusts the container width and cell font size for medium-sized devices.
- **@media (max-width: 500px)**: Further reduces the font size for mobile devices and ensures all elements are touch-friendly.
